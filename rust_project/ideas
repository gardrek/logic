wire bus to allowing connecting more than one wire at once:
  connect wires into a connector
  connector alows you to pick up and connect wires all at once
  numbered by default, names allow you to make things compatible without having to remember order


pull individual lines out of a bus:
  a bus can be placed to make a thing similar to a "node"
    but besides pulling the whole bus out you can also pull out individual lines


color coded views:
  normal - each wire has a color
  value - cyan-blue for positive, orange-yellow for negative
  wires for busses? - wires on a bus are colored based on their position?
  heat map - indicates how often a value is updated with hue ranging from dark black to blue to red

Instead of using pass-through "nodes" to control inputs and outputs of circuit boards, just have them be an adjustable object themselves
  they can still be automatically created and positioned, but also manually (perhaps right click on the borders of the board)
