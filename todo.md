TODO

* Menu system, with which I can:
  * Add, tweak, and delete circuit boards
  * Add and tweak components
  * Delete components without necessarily having a dedicated button
* Properly support arbitrary number of circuit boards, and wiring between them
* With all of the above, I can support "Component-izing" boards
* Save and undo system(s)
* Wire routing (visual)
* Wire bundles/connectors
